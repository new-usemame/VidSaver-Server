i develop in this directory. i run this in a separate directory, Downloads/VidSaver-Server, where i pull from github to update its code. only make changes to this development directory, and once you do generate a commit message and commit and push it.

~ Commit messages 
~ Should be formatted
~ With tildas and new lines
