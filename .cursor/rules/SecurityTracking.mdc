# Security Feature Tracking

When implementing any security-related feature, update `docs/security_features_tracker.md` with a brief bullet point.

## What counts as a security feature:
- Authentication/authorization changes
- Input validation or sanitization
- Path traversal or injection protections
- Rate limiting or access controls
- Encryption or hashing implementations
- Session management changes
- File access restrictions

## Format:
Add a single line under the relevant section:
```
- **Feature name** - Brief description (`file/path.py`)
```

Keep entries concise (one line each).
